# Messenger Issue Tracker and Road Map

**This is not a support section**, if you need support or have a question about the app then please send me an email instead. My email is in the `Help and Feedback` section of the Android App.

This repo will be used for tracking issues and act as a roadmap across all of Pulse's platforms:

1. Android App
2. Backend Server
3. Web Client
4. Chrome App/Extension

and any that may be added in the future (iOS, Mac, Windows, etc?).

To view the currently reported issues and requests, simply hit the [issues](https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-issues/issues) tab at the top of the screen.

## Filing an Issue or Request

If you have an issue with the app or a feature request, this is the place to report it to us and get feedback on it! You'll also be able to tell what work is being done on the issue and when it has been completed.

When filing an issue with us, please follow these simple rules:

1. Search before adding a new issue, if a duplicate is submitted it will be closed.
2. Use proper [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax.
3. Create a fitting title to quickly describe the issue.
4. Take you time and explain the issue, steps to repeat it or other things that may help us to solve it.
5. Note your app version and device name for your primary device (phone/android app).
6. Type is clear English, if we can't understand it then it will unfortunately need to be closed.
7. Label the issue using any relevant tags on the right side of the screen. For example, a bug in the chrome app would be labeled with `Chrome` and `Bug`.

Here is a sample of what a good issue report would look like, feel free to use it as a template:

```markdown
### Cannot return to conversation list after going into the privacy policy section

**Device with issue:** Mac Pro running OSX 10.11.6 and Chrome v53
**Primary device:** Nexus 6P running Android 7.0
**App version:** 1.0.180
**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Go into the about section of the chrome app
2. Click on the privacy policy
3. There is no way to return to the main app without closing the chrome app and reopening it

**Additional information:**

The same is true from any of the Help and Feedback section links in the chrome app

**Possible solution:**

Add a floating action button to the app which has a home icon on it that only shows when the user is outside of the main app. This way a user can click on that and easily return to the conversation list at any time.
```

To report your issue, find the `Issues` link near the top of the web page and click it. Then in the right corner, click the green button labeled `New issue`.
