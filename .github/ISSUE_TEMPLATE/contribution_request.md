## Confirm this Issue

- [ ] This is something that I am looking to code myself and create a PR for, not a feature request for @klinker24 to code.

## Request Details

If you are considering a small change/tweak or bug fix, feel free to just open the PR on the repo you are contributing to!

If you are considering a larger change that you would like feedback on, to discuss implementation details, or to question whether or not it is something I would merge into the app, let's talk here!

### Describe Your Request

Put in any request details you want to discuss here. If you have mockups, have considered any alternatives, or have any questions... Put them here! The more information, the easier time I will have understanding your request.
