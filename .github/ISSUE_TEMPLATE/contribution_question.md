## Confirm this Issue

- [ ] This is something that I am looking to code myself and create a PR for, not a feature request for @klinker24 to code.
- [ ] This is a larger change that I am considering, which I would like feedback on, to discuss implementation details, or to confirm whether or not this is something that would be merged into the app.

If you are considering a small change/tweak or bug fix, feel free to just open the PR on the repo you are contributing to. Otherwise, let's talk here!

## Request Details

### Describe Your Request
